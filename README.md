# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs which is an alternative for REST APIs. The main advantage of GraphQL is clients can ask for exactly what they need. Therefore, the data that client don't need will not include in the response. [Visit GraphQL to get more information](https://graphql.org/).

To illustrate how GraphQL works, I created web server with express and front-end application with React.

## Install GraphQL

You need to install graphql and express-graphql packages to use graphql in express.

```
npm install graphql express-graphql
```
